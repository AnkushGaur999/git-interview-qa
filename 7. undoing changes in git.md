## 🔄 Undoing Changes in Git

Sometimes you make mistakes — Git gives you multiple tools to undo them, depending on **what** and **where** you want to undo.

---

### 🔹 1. `git restore` – **Undo File Changes (Working Directory)**

✅ Introduced in Git 2.23 to simplify undoing local changes.

| Action                        | Command                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Discard changes in a file     | `git restore filename.txt`          |
| Unstage a file (keep changes) | `git restore --staged filename.txt` |

🧠 Use when:

* You want to discard or unstage changes **before commit**.

---

### 🔹 2. `git reset` – **Move Commits or Unstage Changes**

| Mode      | Keeps Files? | Keeps Index? | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `--soft`  | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes        | Moves HEAD only, keeps changes staged |
| `--mixed` | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No         | Unstages files, keeps changes         |
| `--hard`  | ❌ No         | ❌ No         | **Dangerous!** Resets everything      |

#### Examples:

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # Move back 1 commit, keep changes staged
git reset --mixed HEAD~1  # Move back 1 commit, keep changes unstaged
git reset --hard HEAD~1   # Move back 1 commit and delete changes
```

> ⚠️ `--hard` permanently deletes local changes.

---

### 🔹 3. `git revert` – **Undo a Commit (Safely)**

Creates a **new commit** that reverses the changes from a previous one.

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

✅ Safe for shared/public branches because history isn’t rewritten.

🧠 Use when:

* You’ve pushed a commit and need to undo it **without altering history**.

---

### 🔹 4. `git clean` – **Remove Untracked Files**

Removes files that are **not tracked** by Git (not staged or committed).

```bash
git clean -n    # Preview what will be deleted
git clean -f    # Delete untracked files
git clean -fd   # Delete untracked files and directories
```

⚠️ Use with care – this is irreversible unless backed up.
