## 🌿 Git Branching and Merging

Git branches allow you to work on different versions or features of your code **without affecting the main codebase**.

---

### 🔹 1. `git branch` – **List, Create, or Delete Branches**

```bash
git branch            # List all local branches
git branch new-branch # Create a new branch
git branch -d name    # Delete a branch (if merged)
git branch -D name    # Force delete (even if not merged)
```

---

### 🔹 2. `git checkout` – **Switch Between Branches (Legacy)**

```bash
git checkout branch-name
```

You can also use it to create and switch in one command:

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

---

### 🔹 3. `git switch` – **Modern Branch Switching (Recommended)**

Git introduced `switch` to simplify branch operations (since Git 2.23+):

```bash
git switch branch-name          # Switch to existing branch
git switch -c new-branch        # Create and switch to new branch
```

> `git switch` is easier to remember and safer than `checkout` for switching branches.

---

### 🔹 4. `git merge` – **Combine Changes from Another Branch**

```bash
git merge branch-name
```

✅ Merges the specified branch into your current one.

---

## 🔀 Fast-forward vs 3-Way Merge

### ✅ Fast-Forward Merge

Happens when:

* The target branch is **directly ahead** of the current branch (no diverging commits).

```bash
main
 ↓
feature → merged → main
```

🟢 Git just moves the pointer forward. No new commit is created.

```bash
git merge feature
```

---

### 🔀 3-Way Merge

Happens when:

* Both branches have **diverged** and have new commits.

```bash
main → A → B
           ↘
      feature → C
```

🟠 Git will create a **new merge commit** to combine both histories.

```bash
git merge feature
```

You might see:

```text
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
```
