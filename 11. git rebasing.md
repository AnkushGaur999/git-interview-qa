Here’s a detailed explanation of **Git Rebase**, including `git rebase`, `git rebase -i`, and a comparison of **Rebase vs Merge**:

---

## 🔁 1. `git rebase`

**Purpose**: Move or "replay" a branch's commits on top of another branch.

### Syntax:

```bash
git rebase <base-branch>
```

### Example:

```bash
# Start on feature branch
git checkout feature

# Rebase onto main
git rebase main
```

This means:

> “Take all commits from `feature` that aren’t on `main`, and reapply them on top of `main`.”

---

### 📈 Result:

* A **linear history** (no merge commits).
* Great for a **clean commit log**.

---

## ✍️ 2. Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)

**Purpose**: Edit, squash, reorder, or remove commits before applying them.

### Syntax:

```bash
git rebase -i <commit-id or branch>
```

### Example:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

This opens an editor showing the last 3 commits:

```txt
pick 1a2b3c4 Add login page
pick 5d6e7f8 Fix login button
pick 9a0b1c2 Refactor login logic
```

You can:

* `pick` → Keep commit as is
* `reword` → Edit commit message
* `edit` → Modify the commit
* `squash` → Combine with previous commit
* `drop` → Delete the commit

---

### ✅ Common Use:

* Clean up messy commit history before merging
* Combine small fix commits into one meaningful commit

## 🔀 3. Rebase vs Merge

| Feature               | `git rebase`                        | `git merge`                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **History**           | Linear (clean)                      | Non-linear (preserves branching)     |
| **Conflict Handling** | Rebase may cause repeated conflicts | Merge resolves all at once           |
| **Commit Log**        | Rewrite commits                     | Keeps original commit history intact |
| **Usage**             | Cleaner feature integration         | Keeps history of how things evolved  |
| **Safe for Shared?**  | ❌ Not recommended after pushing     | ✅ Safe to use on shared branches     |
| **Command**           | `git rebase main`                   | `git merge main`                     |

---

## 🎯 When to Use

* **Use `merge`**:

  * When preserving full history is important.
  * On shared branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).

* **Use `rebase`**:

  * To make commit history linear and cleaner.
  * Before merging feature branches.

## 📌 Pro Tip: Rebase Before Merge

```bash
git checkout feature
git pull origin main --rebase
# Or
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

Then:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature --ff-only
```
