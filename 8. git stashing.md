## 🎒 Git Stashing?

Sometimes you're working on something, but you need to quickly switch to another branch **without committing your unfinished work**.

👉 That’s where `git stash` comes in — it "stashes" your current changes and gives you a clean working directory.

---

## 🔹 1. `git stash` – **Save Uncommitted Changes**

```bash
git stash
```

✅ This:

* Saves all **modified and staged** files
* Resets your working directory to the last commit

🔧 Optionally, you can add a description:

```bash
git stash save "WIP: Fixing login bug"
```

🧠 Note: This command **does not stash untracked files** (unless you add flags like `-u` or `--include-untracked`).

---

## 🔹 2. `git stash list` – **See All Stashed Changes**

```bash
git stash list
```

✅ Shows all your stashes in order:

```
stash@{0}: WIP on main: Fixing login bug
stash@{1}: WIP on feature-x: Styling updates
```

---

## 🔹 3. `git stash pop` – **Apply and Remove Latest Stash**

```bash
git stash pop
```

✅ Applies the most recent stash **and removes it** from the stash list.

> If there are conflicts, Git will show them and let you resolve them manually.

---

## 🔹 4. `git stash apply` – **Apply Without Removing**

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```

✅ Keeps the stash even after applying, so you can reuse it later.

---

## 🔹 5. `git stash drop` – **Delete a Specific Stash**

```bash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

✅ Frees up stash space by removing a specific entry.

---

## 🔹 6. `git stash clear` – **Remove All Stashes**

```bash
git stash clear
```

🚨 DANGEROUS: Deletes all stashed changes permanently.
