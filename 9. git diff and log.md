## üßæ Git Diff and Log

These commands help you **compare**, **track**, and **investigate** changes in your codebase.

---

### üîπ 1. `git diff` ‚Äì **See What‚Äôs Changed**

Shows line-by-line changes **not yet staged or committed**.

#### Common Usage:

| Command                     | Description                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `git diff`                  | See unstaged changes                     |
| `git diff --staged`         | See changes staged for commit            |
| `git diff branchA..branchB` | Compare differences between two branches |
| `git diff commit1..commit2` | Compare specific commits                 |

#### Example:

```bash
git diff
```

Shows what has been modified in the working directory.

---

### üîπ 2. `git log` ‚Äì **View Commit History**

Shows a detailed history of commits.

#### Basic:

```bash
git log
```

#### Compact view:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

#### Visual view (great for branching):

```bash
git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate
```

‚úÖ This adds:

* `--oneline`: Shortens each commit to 1 line
* `--graph`: ASCII diagram of branches and merges
* `--decorate`: Shows branch/tag names
* `--all`: Includes all branches

---

### üîπ 3. `git blame` ‚Äì **Who Changed What (and When)?**

Shows **who last modified each line** of a file.

```bash
git blame filename.txt
```

Output format:

```
<commit-hash> (<author> <date>) line of code
```

üß† Use this to track down:

* When a bug was introduced
* Who made a specific change

> Combine with `git show <commit-hash>` to view full details.
