# ðŸŒ³ Git Worktrees

Worktrees allow you to have multiple working directories for a single repository, useful for working on several branches at once.

## Creating a Worktree

```sh
git worktree add ../feature feature-branch
```

## Managing Worktrees

- List worktrees: `git worktree list`
- Remove a worktree: `git worktree remove <path>`

---

## Tips

- Each worktree is independent and can be on a different branch.
- Useful for testing, code reviews, or parallel development.
