# üóÇÔ∏è Git Stashing

Git stashing is a powerful feature that allows you to temporarily save changes in your working directory that you are not ready to commit. This is particularly useful when you need to switch branches or pull updates from a remote repository without committing your current changes.

## üì¶ What is Git Stashing?

When you stash changes, Git saves your modified tracked files and reverts your working directory to match the HEAD commit. This allows you to work on something else without losing your current progress.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Commands

### Stash Changes

To stash your changes, use the following command:

```sh
git stash
```

This command will save your changes and revert your working directory to the last commit.

### Stash with a Message

You can also add a message to your stash for easier identification later:

```sh
git stash save "Your message here"
```

### List Stashes

To view a list of all stashed changes, use:

```sh
git stash list
```

This will display all stashes along with their index and message.

### Apply Stash

To apply the most recent stash, use:

```sh
git stash apply
```

If you want to apply a specific stash, specify its index:

```sh
git stash apply stash@{index}
```

### Drop Stash

To remove a specific stash from the list, use:

```
git stash drop stash@{index}
```

To clear all stashes, use:

```sh
git stash clear
```

### Pop Stash

If you want to apply the stash and remove it from the stash list in one command, use:

```sh
git stash pop
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Stashing only saves changes to tracked files. Untracked files can be stashed using `git stash -u`.
- Stashes are stored in a stack, so you can apply or drop them in the order they were created.
