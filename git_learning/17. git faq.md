## Frequently Asked Questions about Git

### 1. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes in source code during software development.

### 2. How does Git differ from other version control systems?
Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows each developer to have a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work and better collaboration.

### 3. What is a commit in Git?
A commit in Git is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. It includes a message describing the changes made, and it allows you to track the history of your project.

### 4. How do I revert a commit?
To revert a commit, you can use the command `git revert <commit_hash>`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit.

### 5. What is a branch in Git?
A branch in Git is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on features or fixes in isolation from the main codebase. You can merge branches back into the main branch once the work is complete.

### 6. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two branches have changes to the same line in a file, and Git cannot automatically resolve which change to keep. You will need to manually resolve the conflict before completing the merge.

### 7. How can I see the history of my commits?
You can view the commit history by using the command `git log`. This will display a list of commits along with their hashes, authors, dates, and messages.

### 8. What is the purpose of `.gitignore`?
The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that Git should ignore. This is useful for excluding temporary files, build artifacts, or sensitive information that should not be tracked in the repository.

### 9. How do I create a new branch?
To create a new branch, use the command `git branch <branch_name>`. You can then switch to the new branch using `git checkout <branch_name>` or create and switch in one command with `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.

### 10. What are Git hooks?
Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow. They can be used to enforce policies, automate tasks, or integrate with other tools.

### 11. How can I stash my changes?
You can stash your changes using the command `git stash`. This temporarily saves your uncommitted changes, allowing you to switch branches or pull updates without losing your work.

### 12. What is rebasing?
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It is often used to maintain a cleaner project history by integrating changes from one branch into another.

### 13. How do I resolve a merge conflict?
To resolve a merge conflict, open the conflicting files and look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`). Edit the file to resolve the differences, then stage the changes and commit them.

### 14. Can I undo a pushed commit?
Yes, you can undo a pushed commit by using `git revert <commit_hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes. Alternatively, you can use `git reset` followed by a force push, but this is not recommended for shared branches.

### 15. Where can I find more resources to learn Git?
There are many resources available online, including the official Git documentation, tutorials, and community forums. Books and courses on version control can also provide in-depth knowledge.
