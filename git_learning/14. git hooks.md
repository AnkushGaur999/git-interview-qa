# ü™ù Git Hooks

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commits, pushes, and receives. They allow you to automate tasks and enforce policies in your Git workflow. Hooks are stored in the `hooks` directory of your Git repository, located at `.git/hooks`.

## Types of Git Hooks

1. **Client-side Hooks**: These hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging. They include:
   - `pre-commit`: Runs before a commit is made. Useful for running tests or linters.
   - `prepare-commit-msg`: Runs before the commit message editor is fired up.
   - `commit-msg`: Runs after the commit message is entered. Can be used to validate the commit message format.
   - `post-commit`: Runs after a commit is made. Useful for notifications or logging.

2. **Server-side Hooks**: These hooks are triggered by network operations such as receiving pushes. They include:
   - `pre-receive`: Runs before any refs are updated. Can be used to enforce policies on incoming changes.
   - `update`: Runs before each ref is updated. Useful for checking the state of the branch being pushed.
   - `post-receive`: Runs after all refs have been updated. Can be used for notifications or deployment.

## Setting Up Git Hooks

To set up a Git hook, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your repository's `.git/hooks` directory.
2. Create a new file with the name of the hook you want to set up (e.g., `pre-commit`).
3. Make the file executable:
   - On Unix-based systems, run: `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
4. Add your script to the file. For example, a simple pre-commit hook might look like this:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   echo "Running pre-commit checks..."
   # Add your commands here
   ```

## Common Use Cases for Git Hooks

- **Code Quality Checks**: Use `pre-commit` hooks to run linters or tests before allowing a commit.
- **Enforcing Commit Message Standards**: Use `commit-msg` hooks to ensure commit messages follow a specific format.
- **Automated Deployments**: Use `post-receive` hooks to trigger deployments to a server after code is pushed.
- **Notifications**: Send notifications to a chat service or email after certain Git events.

## Conclusion

Git hooks are a powerful feature that can help automate and enforce best practices in your development workflow. By leveraging hooks, you can ensure code quality, maintain consistency, and streamline your processes.
