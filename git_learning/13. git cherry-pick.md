# üçí Git Cherry-Pick

Cherry-picking allows you to apply specific commits from one branch onto another. This is useful when you want to bring in just a few changes without merging an entire branch.

## Usage

```sh
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

## Example

Suppose you want to apply a bug fix from a feature branch to your main branch:

```sh
git checkout main
git cherry-pick abc1234
```

## Tips

- Resolve conflicts if they occur, then continue with `git cherry-pick --continue`.
- Avoid cherry-picking merge commits unless you know what you‚Äôre doing.
