# 7. Undoing Changes in Git

In Git, there are several ways to undo changes depending on what you want to achieve. This guide will cover four primary commands: `git restore`, `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git clean`. Each command serves a different purpose and can be used in various scenarios.

## 1. git restore

The `git restore` command is used to restore working tree files. It can be used to discard changes in the working directory.

### Usage

- To restore a specific file to the last committed state:

  ```sh
  git restore <file>
  ```

- To restore all files:

  ```sh
  git restore .
  ```

- To restore a file from a specific commit:

  ```sh
  git restore --source <commit> <file>
  ```

## 2. git reset

The `git reset` command is used to reset your current HEAD to a specified state. It can be used to unstage files or to move the HEAD pointer to a previous commit.

### Usage

- To unstage a file:

  ```bash
  git reset <file>
  ```

- To reset to a specific commit (soft, mixed, or hard):
  ```
  git reset --soft <commit>   # Keeps changes in the working directory
  git reset --mixed <commit>  # Default, keeps changes in the working directory
  git reset --hard <commit>   # Discards all changes
  ```

## 3. git revert

The `git revert` command is used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit. This is a safe way to undo changes as it does not alter the commit history.

### Usage

- To revert a specific commit:

  ```sh
  git revert <commit>
  ```

- To revert multiple commits:

  ```sh
  git revert <commit1> <commit2> ...
  ```

## 4. git clean

The `git clean` command is used to remove untracked files from the working directory. This is useful for cleaning up files that are not being tracked by Git.

### Usage

- To see which files would be removed:

  ```sh
  git clean -n
  ```

- To remove untracked files:

  ```sh
  git clean -f
  ```

- To remove untracked directories:

  ```sh
  git clean -fd
  ```

## Summary

- Use `git restore` to discard changes in the working directory.
- Use `git reset` to unstage files or move the HEAD pointer.
- Use `git revert` to safely undo changes by creating a new commit.
- Use `git clean` to remove untracked files and directories.

By understanding these commands, you can effectively manage and undo changes in your Git repositories.
