# 9. Git Diff and Log

## üìú Overview

In this section, we will explore two essential commands in Git: `git diff` and `git log`. These commands are crucial for understanding changes in your codebase and tracking the history of your project.

## üîç Git Diff

The `git diff` command is used to show the differences between various states of your repository. It can be used to compare changes in files, branches, commits, and more.

### Basic Usage

- **Show unstaged changes**:  
  To see changes that have not yet been staged for commit:
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```

- **Show staged changes**:  
  To view changes that are staged for the next commit:
  ```
  git diff --cached
  ```

- **Compare two commits**:  
  To see the differences between two specific commits:
  ```
  git diff <commit1> <commit2>
  ```

- **Compare a branch with the current branch**:  
  To see what changes are in a branch compared to your current branch:
  ```
  git diff <branch-name>
  ```

### Options

- **--name-only**:  
  Show only the names of changed files.
  ```
  git diff --name-only
  ```

- **--stat**:  
  Show a summary of changes (insertions and deletions).
  
  ```bash
  git diff --stat
  ```

## üìú Git Log

The `git log` command is used to view the commit history of your repository. It provides a detailed record of all commits made, including the author, date, and commit message.

### Basic Usage

- **View commit history**:  
  To see the full commit history:
  ```bash
  git log
  ```

- **View a specific number of commits**:  
  To limit the number of commits displayed:
  ```
  git log -n <number>
  ```

- **View a specific file's history**:  
  To see the commit history for a specific file:
  ```
  git log <file-name>
  ```

### Formatting Options

- **--oneline**:  
  Display each commit on a single line.

```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```

- **--graph**:  
  Show a graphical representation of the branch structure.
 
  ```bash
  git log --graph
  ```

- **--pretty=format:**:  
  Customize the output format of the log.
  ```
  git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
  ```

## üìö Summary

- Use `git diff` to compare changes in your working directory and staged files.
- Use `git log` to view the history of commits in your repository.
- Both commands are essential for effective version control and understanding the evolution of your project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practice

Try using `git diff` and `git log` in your own repositories to get comfortable with these commands. Experiment with different options to see how they affect the output.
