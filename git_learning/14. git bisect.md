# 🔍 Git Bisect

`git bisect` helps you find the commit that introduced a bug by performing a binary search through your commit history.

## Usage

```sh
git bisect start
git bisect bad
git bisect good <commit-hash>
```

Git will check out commits for you to test. Mark each as `good` or `bad` until the culprit is found.

## Example

```sh
git bisect start
git bisect bad                # Current commit is bad
git bisect good v1.0.0        # v1.0.0 is known good
# Test, then mark as good/bad as prompted
```

## Tips

- Use scripts to automate testing with `git bisect run <script>`.
- Reset with `git bisect reset` when finished.
