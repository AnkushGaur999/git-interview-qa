## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Merge Conflicts
**Problem:** When merging branches, you may encounter conflicts if changes overlap.

**Solution:**
- Git will mark the files with conflicts. Open the files and look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers.
- Manually edit the file to resolve the conflicts, then stage the changes with `git add <filename>`.
- Complete the merge with `git commit`.

### 2. Detached HEAD State
**Problem:** You are in a detached HEAD state, meaning you are not on a branch.

**Solution:**
- To return to a branch, use `git checkout <branch-name>`.
- If you want to keep the changes made in the detached state, create a new branch with `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`.

### 3. Untracked Files
**Problem:** You have files that are not being tracked by Git.

**Solution:**
- To track a file, use `git add <filename>`.
- To ignore certain files, add them to your `.gitignore` file.

### 4. Reverting a Commit
**Problem:** You want to undo a commit that has already been pushed.

**Solution:**
- Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to create a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.

### 5. Stale Branches
**Problem:** You have branches that are no longer needed.

**Solution:**
- To delete a local branch, use `git branch -d <branch-name>`.
- To delete a remote branch, use `git push origin --delete <branch-name>`.

### 6. Authentication Issues
**Problem:** You encounter authentication errors when pushing to a remote repository.

**Solution:**
- Ensure your credentials are correct. You may need to update your stored credentials or use SSH keys.
- Check your remote URL with `git remote -v` and ensure it is correct.

### 7. Repository Corruption
**Problem:** Your Git repository appears to be corrupted.

**Solution:**
- Run `git fsck` to check the integrity of the repository.
- If issues are found, you may need to restore from a backup or clone a fresh copy of the repository.
