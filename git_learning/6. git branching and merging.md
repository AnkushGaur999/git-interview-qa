# Git Branching and Merging

## Overview

Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work independently without affecting the main codebase. Merging is the process of bringing those changes back together.

## Creating a Branch

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```
git branch <branch-name>
```

This command creates a new branch but does not switch to it. To create and switch to a new branch in one command, use:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

## Switching Branches

To switch to an existing branch, use:

```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

You can also use the newer command:

```
git switch <branch-name>
```

## Merging Branches

To merge changes from one branch into another, first switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually `main` or `master`):

```
git checkout main
```

Then, use the merge command:

```
git merge <branch-name>
```

### Merge Strategies

Git provides different merge strategies:

1. **Fast-Forward Merge**: This occurs when there are no new commits on the target branch since the branch being merged was created. Git simply moves the pointer forward.

2. **Three-Way Merge**: This occurs when there are new commits on both branches. Git creates a new merge commit that combines the changes.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

Sometimes, merging can lead to conflicts if changes in the branches are incompatible. Git will mark the files with conflicts, and you will need to resolve them manually. After resolving conflicts, use:

```
git add <file>
```

Then, complete the merge with:

```
git commit
```

## Deleting a Branch

Once a branch has been merged and is no longer needed, you can delete it using:

```
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

If the branch has not been merged, and you still want to delete it, use:

```
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

## Summary

- Use branches to work on features independently.
- Merge branches to integrate changes.
- Resolve conflicts when they arise.
- Clean up by deleting branches that are no longer needed.
